- Maintain a pointer in the Packer class so that we don't have to repeatedly
  call out to buffer methods. It can be set on construction and only needs
  to be updated when the internal bytearray is resized.

- The custom packers need to be merged with the global ones rather than
  simply using the ones the user passed. This is so that any global
  packers are taken into consideration.

- Use an LRU cache for cyclic object handling instead of a potentially
  unbounded dict. This cache must have the ability to mark objects as
  non-evictable when they are being packed.

- The LRU cache can also be used by the proxy to avoid having to unpack
  objects all the time. Not every object should be cached, but the ones
  that are complicated to do so (custom objects, for example) should be.
  This should be user-tunable.

- Also allow None, True and False to be stored inline.

- In the Proxy class, a call to `unpack` without arguments should bump
  an internal offset member so that the next call will unpack the following
  element. This requires each object to implement a way to know the total
  size it takes up in the internal mapping, though.
